    "questionText": "Which statement best describes the relationship between computer architecture, organization, and design?",
    "options": [
      "Organization is the highest level, followed by architecture, then design",
      "Architecture defines what programmer sees, organization defines how it's implemented, design defines physical realization",
      "They are all the same concept",
      "Design comes first, then organization, finally architecture"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Computer architecture defines the programmer-visible interface (ISA), organization defines the internal structure and interconnections, and design involves the physical implementation details like circuit design and chip layout."
